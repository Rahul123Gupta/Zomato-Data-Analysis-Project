🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of Zomato restaurant data to understand customer behavior, restaurant performance, and pricing patterns. Using various data science techniques, the project explores how factors like location, cuisine type, ratings, and cost influence dining preferences and business success.

🔍 Project Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent data.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and correlations.

Analyze restaurant ratings, cuisines, and cost distribution across different cities.

Discover insights about popular cuisines, top-rated restaurants, and customer trends.

Create visual dashboards to represent data findings in an easy-to-understand way.

🧰 Technologies and Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for code execution and analysis

Tableau / Power BI (optional) for interactive visualization

EDA and Data Visualization techniques for deep insight generation

📈 Insights and Outcomes

Through this project, we uncover valuable insights into the Zomato restaurant ecosystem — including what drives high ratings, how pricing varies by cuisine and city, and which areas have the most food demand.
These insights can help restaurant owners, marketers, and analysts make data-driven decisions to improve business performance and enhance customer satisfaction.
